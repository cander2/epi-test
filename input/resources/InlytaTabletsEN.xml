									<ul>
										<li><b>If you have high blood pressure.</b></li>
                  </ul> 
                <p>Inlyta can raise your blood pressure. It is important to check your blood pressure before you take this medicine, and regularly while you are taking it. If you have high blood pressure (hypertension) you may be treated with medicines to reduce the blood pressure. Your doctor should make sure that your blood pressure is under control before starting Inlyta treatment, and while on treatment with this medicine.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>If you have thyroid gland problems.</b></li>
                  </ul> 	
                <p>Inlyta can cause thyroid gland problems. Tell your doctor if you get tired more easily, generally feel colder than other people, or your voice deepens whilst taking this medicine. Your thyroid function should be checked before you take Inlyta and regularly while you are taking it. If your thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone before, or while on treatment with this medicine, you should be treated with thyroid hormone replacement.</p>

                 <ul>
										<li><b>If you have had a recent problem with blood clots in your veins and arteries (types of blood vessels), including stroke, heart attack, embolism, or thrombosis.</b></li>
                  </ul> 	
              <p>Get emergency help right away and call your doctor if you get symptoms such as chest pain or pressure; pain in your arms, back, neck or jaw; shortness of breath; numbness or weakness on one side of your body; trouble talking; headache; vision changes; or dizziness while on treatment with this medicine.</p>

                  <ul>

                  </ul> 	
                <p>Inlyta may increase your chance of bleeding. Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding, coughing up of blood or bloody sputum while on treatment with this medicine.</p>
                  
                  <ul>

                  </ul> 	
                <p>Inlyta may increase the risk of developing a hole in the stomach or intestine or formation of fistula (abnormal tube-like passage from one normal body cavity to another body cavity or the skin).</p>
                <p>Tell your doctor if you have severe abdominal pain while on treatment with this medicine.</p>

										<li><b>If you are going to have an operation or if you have an unhealed wound.</b></li>
                  </ul> 	
                <p>Your doctor should stop Inlyta at least 24 hours before your operation as it may affect wound healing. Your treatment with this medicine should be restarted when the wound has adequately healed.</p>

                  <ul>
										<li><b>If during treatment with this medicine, you get symptoms such as headache, confusion, seizures (fits), or changes in vision with or without high blood pressure.</b></li>

                  <ul>
										<li><b>If you have liver problems.</b></li>
