							<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
								<p>Braftovi is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance encorafenib. Changes (mutations) in the BRAF gene can produce proteins that cause the cancer to grow. Braftovi targets proteins made from this changed BRAF gene.</p>
                <p>It is used in combination with another medicine containing binimetinib to treat adult patients with a type of skin cancer called melanoma when it has</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a particular change (mutation) in a gene responsible for producing a protein called BRAF, and</li>
                <li>spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When Braftovi is used in combination with binimetinib, which targets another protein that stimulates cancer cell growth, the combination slows down or stops the growth of your cancer.</p>
                <p>Braftovi is also used in combination with another medicine cetuximab, to treat adult patients with a type of large intestine cancer when it has</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a particular change (mutation) in a gene responsible for producing a protein called BRAF, and</li>
                <li>spread to other parts of the body of patients who have been previously treated with other anticancer medicines</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When Braftovi is used in combination with cetuximab (which binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)), a protein on the surface of certain cancer cells), the combination slows down or stops the growth of your cancer.</p>

							<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
              <p>Before starting treatment your doctor will check for the BRAF mutation.</p>
                <p>As Braftovi is to be used in combination with binimetinib to treat melanoma, read the binimetinib leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet.</p>
              <p>As Braftovi is to be used in combination with cetuximab to treat large intestine cancer, read the cetuximab leaflet carefully as well as this leaflet.</p>
              <p><b>Do not take Braftovi</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>if you are allergic to encorafenib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</li>
									</ul>
              <p><b>Warnings and precautions</b></p>
              <p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Braftovi, about all of your medical conditions, particularly if you have any of the following:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>heart problems including alteration of the electrical activity of your heart (QT interval prolongation)</li>
										<li>bleeding problems or if you are taking medicines that may cause bleeding</li>
										<li>eye problems</li>
										<li>liver or kidney problems</li>
									</ul>

              <p>Tell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma or large intestine cancer, as Braftovi may worsen certain other types of cancers.</p>
              <p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get the following while you are taking this medicine:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Heart problems: Braftovi when taken with binimetinib can make your heart work less well, alter the electrical activity of your heart called “QT interval prolongation” or make existing heart problems worse. Your doctor will check that your heart is working properly before and during your treatment with these medicines. Talk to your doctor immediately if you have any symptoms of heart problems such as feeling dizzy, tired, lightheaded, if you have shortness of breath, if you feel like your heart is pounding, racing, beating irregularly, or if you have swelling in the legs.</li>
										<li>Bleeding problems: Braftovi may cause serious bleeding problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if you have any symptoms of bleeding problems such as coughing up of blood, blood clots, vomit containing blood or that looks like “coffee grounds”, red or black stools that look like tar, passing blood in the urine, stomach (abdominal) pain, unusual vaginal bleeding. Also tell your doctor if you have headache, dizziness or weakness.</li>
										<li>Eye problems: Braftovi, when taken with binimetinib, can cause serious eye problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if you get blurred vision, loss of vision, or other vision changes (e.g. coloured dots in your vision), halo (seeing blurred outline around objects). Your doctor will examine your eyes for any problems with your sight while you are taking Braftovi.</li>
										<li>Skin changes: Braftovi may cause other types of skin cancer such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. New melanomas may also occur while taking Braftovi. Your doctor will check your skin for any new skin cancers before treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months after you stop taking Braftovi. Tell your doctor immediately if you detect skin changes during and after treatment including: new wart, skin sore or reddish bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in size or colour of a mole. Additionally, your doctor needs to check for squamous cell carcinoma on your head, neck, mouth and lymph glands, and you will have CT scans regularly. This is a precaution in case a squamous cell carcinoma develops inside your body. Genital examinations (for women) and anal examinations are also recommended before and at the end of your treatment.</li>
										<li>Liver problems: Braftovi can cause abnormal blood tests related to how your liver works (raised levels of liver enzymes). Your doctor will run blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment.</li>
										<li>Kidney problems: Braftovi can alter your kidney activity (often abnormal blood tests, more rarely dehydration and vomiting). Your doctor will run blood tests to monitor your kidneys before and during treatment. Drink plenty of fluids during treatment. Tell your doctor immediately if you vomit and become dehydrated.</li>
									</ul>
              <p><b>Children and adolescents</b></p>
              <p>Braftovi is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This medicine has not been studied in this age group.</p>
              <p><b>Other medicines and Braftovi</b></p>
              <p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p>
              <p>Some medicines may affect how Braftovi works or make it more likely that you will have side effects.</p>
              <p>In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking anything in this list or any other medicines:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>some medicines to treat fungal infections (such as itraconazole, posaconazole, fluconazole)</li>
										<li>some medicines to treat bacterial infections (such as rifampicin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, penicillin)</li>
										<li>medicines typically used to treat epilepsy (seizures) (such as phenytoin, carbamazepine)</li>
										<li>medicines typically used to treat cancer (such as methotrexate, imatinib)</li>
										<li>medicines typically used to treat high cholesterol (such as rosuvastatin, atorvastatin)</li>
										<li>an herbal treatment for depression: St. John’s wort</li>
										<li>some medicines for HIV treatment such as ritonavir, amprenavir, raltegravir, dolutegravir</li>
										<li>birth control medicines containing hormones</li>
										<li>medicines typically used to treat high blood pressure (such as diltiazem, bosentan, furosemide)</li>

									</ul>
              <p><b>Braftovi with food and drink</b></p>
              <p>Do not have grapefruit juice during your treatment with Braftovi. This is because it could increase Braftovi side effects.</p>
              <p><b>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility</b></p>
              <p><u>Pregnancy</u></p>
              <p>Braftovi is not recommended during pregnancy. It may cause harm or birth defects to an unborn baby.</p>
              <p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.</p>
              <p>If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use reliable contraception while you are taking Braftovi, and you must continue to use reliable contraception for at least 1 month after taking your last dose. Birth control medicines containing hormones (such as pills, injections, patches, implants and certain intrauterine devices (IUDs) that release hormones) may not work as well as expected while you are taking Braftovi. You should use another reliable method of birth control such as a barrier method (e.g. condom) so you do not become pregnant while you are taking this medicine.</p>
              <p>Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice.</p>
              <p>Contact your doctor straightaway if you become pregnant while taking Braftovi.</p>

              <p><u>Breast feeding</u></p>
              <p>Braftovi is not recommended while breast feeding. It is not known if Braftovi passes into breast milk.</p>
              <p>If you are breast-feeding, or planning to breast feed, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.</p>

              <p><u>Fertility</u></p>
              <p>Braftovi may reduce sperm count in males. This could affect the ability to father a child. Talk to your doctor if this is a concern for you.</p>

              <p><b>Driving and using machines</b></p>
              <p>Braftovi can affect your ability to drive or use machines. Avoid driving or using machines if you have any problems with your vision, or have any other side effects that can affect your ability to drive or use machines (see section 4), while taking Braftovi. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure you can drive.</p>

             <li>swelling in the legs</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Eye problems: Braftovi, when taken with binimetinib can cause serious eye problems such as fluid to leak under the retina in the eye, leading to detachment of different layers in the eye (retinal epithelial pigmental detachment). Call your doctor right away if you get these symptoms of eye problems:</p>
             <ul>
             <li>blurred vision, loss of vision, or other vision changes (such as coloured dots in your vision)</li>

              </ul>
             
             <p>Muscle problems: Braftovi, when taken with binimetinib can cause breakdown of muscles (rhabdomyolysis) which can lead to kidney damage and can be fatal; signs and symptoms can include:</p>
             <ul>
             <li>muscle pain, cramps, stiffness or spasm</li>
             <li>dark urine </li>
             </ul>
             <p>Other skin cancers: Treatment with Braftovi may result in a type of skin cancer such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Usually, these skin changes (see also section 2) are confined to a small area and can be removed with surgery and treatment with Braftovi can continue without interruption. Some people taking Braftovi may also notice new melanomas. These melanomas are usually removed by surgery and treatment with Braftovi can continue without interruption.</p>
