                <h3>2.1 Recommended Dose and Schedule</h3>
                <p>The recommended dose of IBRANCE is a 125 mg tablet taken orally once daily for 21
                    consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a complete cycle
                    of 28 days. IBRANCE tablet may be taken with or without food <i>[see <a
                            href="#S12.3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)</a>]</i>.</p>
                <p>Administer the recommended dose of an aromatase inhibitor when given with
                    IBRANCE. Please refer to the Full Prescribing Information for the aromatase
                    inhibitor being used.</p>
                <p>When given with IBRANCE, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg
                    administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the
                    Full Prescribing Information of fulvestrant.</p>
                <p>Patients should be encouraged to take their dose of IBRANCE at approximately the
                    same time each day.</p>
                <p>If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken.
                    The next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time. IBRANCE tablets
                    should be swallowed whole (do not chew, crush, or split them prior to
                    swallowing). Tablets should not be ingested if they are broken, cracked, or
                    otherwise not intact.</p>
                <p>Pre/perimenopausal women treated with the combination IBRANCE plus an aromatase
                    inhibitor or fulvestrant therapy should also be treated with luteinizing
                    hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists according to current clinical practice
                    standards.</p>
                <p>For men treated with combination IBRANCE plus aromatase inhibitor therapy,
                    consider treatment with an LHRH agonist according to current clinical practice
                    standards.</p>

                <h3>5.1 Neutropenia</h3>
                <p>Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-2 with an
                    incidence of 80% and PALOMA-3 with an incidence of 83%. A Grade ≥3 decrease in
                    neutrophil counts was reported in 66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus
                    letrozole in PALOMA-2 and 66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in
                    PALOMA-3. In PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3, the median time to first episode of any
                    grade neutropenia was 15 days and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia
                    was 7 days <i>[see <a href="#S6.1">ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)</a>]</i>.</p>
                <p>Monitor complete blood counts prior to starting IBRANCE therapy and at the
                    beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as
                    clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting
                    treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4
                    neutropenia <i>[see <a href="#S2.2">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)</a>]</i>.</p>
                <p>Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of patients exposed to IBRANCE
                    across PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed
                    in PALOMA-3. Physicians should inform patients to promptly report any episodes
                    of fever <i>[see <a href="#S17">PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)</a>]</i>.</p>

                <h3>5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis</h3>
                <p>Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or
                    pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6
                    (CDK4/6) inhibitors, including IBRANCE when taken in combination with endocrine
                    therapy.</p>
                <p>Across clinical trials (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1.0% of IBRANCE-treated
                    patients had ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3 or 4 and no fatal
                    cases were reported. Additional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in
                    the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported <i>[see <a href="#S6.2">ADVERSE
                    REACTIONS (6.2)</a>]</i>.</p>
                <p>Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g.
                    hypoxia, cough, dyspnea). In patients who have new or worsening respiratory
                    symptoms and are suspected to have developed pneumonitis, interrupt IBRANCE
                    immediately and evaluate the patient. Permanently discontinue IBRANCE in
                    patients with severe ILD or pneumonitis <i>[see <a href="#S2.2">DOSAGE AND
                    ADMINISTRATION (2.2)</a>]</i>.</p>

                <h3>5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3>
                <p>Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can
                    cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction
                    studies, administration of palbociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during
                    organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal exposures that were
                    ≥4 times the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise
                    pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive
                    potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IBRANCE and for
                    at least 3 weeks after the last dose <i>[see <a href="#S8.1">USE IN SPECIFIC

                <h3>6.1 Clinical Studies Experience</h3>
                <p>Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, the adverse
                    reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and
                    may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p>

                <h4>PALOMA-2: IBRANCE plus Letrozole</h4>
                <h5>Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced or
                    metastatic breast cancer for initial endocrine based therapy</h5>
                <p>The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) versus placebo
                    plus letrozole was evaluated in PALOMA-2. The data described below reflect
                    exposure to IBRANCE in 444 out of 666 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative
                    advanced breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of IBRANCE plus letrozole in
                    PALOMA-2. The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus letrozole was 19.8
                    months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus letrozole arm was
                    13.8 months.</p>
                <p>Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of
                    patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. No dose reduction was allowed for
                    letrozole in PALOMA-2.</p>
                <p>Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 43 of
                    444 (9.7%) patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole and in 13 of 222 (5.9%)
                    patients receiving placebo plus letrozole. Adverse reactions leading to
                    permanent discontinuation for patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole included
                    neutropenia (1.1%) and alanine aminotransferase increase (0.7%).</p>
                <p>The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in patients in the
                    IBRANCE plus letrozole arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, infections,
                    leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, anemia, rash,
                    asthenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, decreased appetite, dry skin, pyrexia, and
                    dysgeusia.</p>
                <p>The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in patients
                    receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole by descending frequency were neutropenia,

                <h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3>
                <h4>Risk Summary</h4>
                <p>Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can
                    cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <i>[see <a href="#S12.1">CLINICAL
                    PHARMACOLOGY (12.1)</a>]</i>. There are no available data in pregnant women to
                    inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration
                    of palbociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in
                    embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal exposures that were ≥4 times the human
                    clinical exposure based on AUC <i>(see <a href="#Data">DATA</a>)</i>. Advise
                    pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p>
                <p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the
                    indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated
                    background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized
                    pregnancies is 2%–4% and 15%–20%, respectively.</p>

                <h4 id="Data">Data</h4>
                <h5>Animal Data</h5>
                <p>In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, palbociclib
                    was administered orally for 15 days before mating through to Day 7 of pregnancy,
                    which did not cause embryo toxicity at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day with maternal
                    systemic exposures approximately 4 times the human exposure (AUC) at the
                    recommended dose.</p>
                <p>In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals
                    received oral doses of palbociclib up to 300 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day,
                    respectively, during the period of organogenesis. The maternally toxic dose of
                    300 mg/kg/day was fetotoxic in rats, resulting in reduced fetal body weights. At
                    doses ≥100 mg/kg/day in rats, there was an increased incidence of a skeletal
                    variation (increased incidence of a rib present at the seventh cervical
                    vertebra). At the maternally toxic dose of 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, there was an
                    increased incidence of skeletal variations, including small phalanges in the
                    forelimb. At 300 mg/kg/day in rats and 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, the maternal
                    systemic exposures were approximately 4 and 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at
                    the recommended dose, respectively.</p>
                <p>CDK4/6 double knockout mice have been reported to die in late stages of fetal
                    development (gestation Day 14.5 until birth) due to severe anemia. However,
                    knockout mouse data may not be predictive of effects in humans due to
                    differences in degree of target inhibition.</p>

                <h3>8.2 Lactation</h3>
                <h4>Risk Summary</h4>
                <p>There is no information regarding the presence of palbociclib in human milk, its
                    effects on milk production, or the breastfed infant. Because of the potential
                    for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from IBRANCE, advise a
                    lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with IBRANCE and for 3 weeks
                    after the last dose.</p>

                <h3>8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3>
                <h4>Pregnancy Testing</h4>
                <p>Based on animal studies, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a
                    pregnant woman <i>[see <a href="#S8.1">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)</a>]</i>.
                    Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting
                    treatment with IBRANCE.</p>

                <h4>Contraception</h4>
                <h5>Females</h5>
                <p>IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <i>[see <a
                            href="#S8.1">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)</a>]</i>. Advise females
                    of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with
                    IBRANCE and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.</p>
                <h5>Males</h5>
                <p>Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female
                    partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during
                    treatment with IBRANCE and for 3 months after the last dose <i>[see <a
                            href="#S13.1">NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)</a>]</i>.</p>

                <h4>Infertility</h4>
                <h5>Males</h5>
                <p>Based on animal studies, IBRANCE may impair fertility in males of reproductive
                    potential <i>[see <a href="#S13.1">NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)</a>]</i>.</p>

                <h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3>
                <p>The safety and efficacy of IBRANCE in pediatric patients have not been studied.</p>
                <p>Altered glucose metabolism (glycosuria, hyperglycemia, decreased insulin)
                    associated with changes in the pancreas (islet cell vacuolation), eye
                    (cataracts, lens degeneration), kidney (tubule vacuolation, chronic progressive
                    nephropathy) and adipose tissue (atrophy) were identified in a 27 week
                    repeat-dose toxicology study in rats that were immature at the beginning of the
                    studies and were most prevalent in males at oral palbociclib doses ≥30 mg/kg/day
                    (approximately 11 times the adult human exposure [AUC] at the recommended dose).
                    Some of these findings (glycosuria/hyperglycemia, pancreatic islet cell
                    vacuolation, and kidney tubule vacuolation) were present with lower incidence
                    and severity in a 15 week repeat-dose toxicology study in immature rats. Altered
                    glucose metabolism or associated changes in the pancreas, eye, kidney and
                    adipose tissue were not identified in a 27-week repeat-dose toxicology study in
                    rats that were mature at the beginning of the study and in dogs in repeat-dose
                    toxicology studies up to 39 weeks duration.</p>
                <p>Toxicities in teeth independent of altered glucose metabolism were observed in
                    rats. Administration of 100 mg/kg palbociclib for 27 weeks (approximately 15
                    times the adult human exposure [AUC] at the recommended dose) resulted in
                    abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (discolored, ameloblast
                    degeneration/necrosis, mononuclear cell infiltrate). Other toxicities of
                    potential concern to pediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile
                    animals.</p>

                <h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3>
                <p>Of 444 patients who received IBRANCE in PALOMA-2, 181 patients (41%) were ≥65
                    years of age and 48 patients (11%) were ≥75 years of age. Of 347 patients who
                    received IBRANCE in PALOMA-3, 86 patients (25%) were ≥65 years of age and 27
                    patients (8%) were ≥75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or
                    effectiveness of IBRANCE were observed between these patients and younger
                    patients.</p>

                <h3>8.6 Hepatic Impairment</h3>
                <p>No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic
                    impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B). For patients with severe hepatic
                    impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the recommended dose of IBRANCE is 75 mg once
                    daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a
                    complete cycle of 28 days <i>[see <a href="#S2.2">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
                            (2.2)</a>]</i>. Based on a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with
                    varying degrees of hepatic function, the palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound
                    AUC<sub>
                        INF</sub>) decreased by 17% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment
                    (Child-Pugh class A), and increased by 34% and 77% in subjects with moderate
                    (Child-Pugh class B) and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment,
                    respectively, relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. Peak
                    palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound C<sub>max</sub>) increased by 7%, 38% and
                    72% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to
                    subjects with normal hepatic function <i>[see <a href="#S12.3">CLINICAL

                    fulvestrant for dose modifications related to hepatic impairment.</p>

                <h3>8.7 Renal Impairment</h3>
                <p>No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal
                    impairment (CrCl >15 mL/min).</p>

            <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                <h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3>
                <p>Palbociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. Cyclin D1
                    and CDK4/6 are downstream of signaling pathways which lead to cellular
                    proliferation. In vitro, palbociclib reduced cellular proliferation of estrogen
                    receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines by blocking progression of the
                    cell from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. Treatment of breast cancer cell
                    lines with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to decreased
                    retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation resulting in reduced E2F expression
                    and signaling, and increased growth arrest compared to treatment with each drug
                    alone. In vitro treatment of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines with the
                    combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens led to increased cell senescence
                    compared to each drug alone, which was sustained for up to 6 days following
                    palbociclib removal and was greater if antiestrogen treatment was continued. In
                    vivo studies using a patient-derived ER-positive breast cancer xenograft model
                    demonstrated that the combination of palbociclib and letrozole increased the
                    inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, downstream signaling, and tumor growth
                    compared to each drug alone.</p>
                <p>Human bone marrow mononuclear cells treated with palbociclib in the presence or
                    absence of an anti-estrogen in vitro did not become senescent and resumed
                    proliferation following palbociclib withdrawal.</p>

                <h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3>
                <h4>Cardiac Electrophysiology</h4>
                <p>The effect of palbociclib on the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was
                    evaluated using time-matched electrocardiograms (ECGs) evaluating the change
                    from baseline and corresponding pharmacokinetic data in 77 patients with breast
                    cancer. Palbociclib had no large effect on QTc (i.e., >20 ms) at 125 mg once
                    daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a
                    complete cycle of 28 days.</p>

                <h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3>
                <p>The pharmacokinetics (PK) of palbociclib were characterized in patients with
                    solid tumors including advanced breast cancer and in healthy subjects.</p>

                <h4>Absorption</h4>
                <p>The maximum observed concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of palbociclib is generally
                    observed between 4 to 12 hours (time to reach maximum concentration, T<sub>max</sub>)
                    following oral administration of IBRANCE tablets. The mean absolute
                    bioavailability of IBRANCE after an oral 125 mg dose is 46%. In the dosing range
                    of 25 mg to 225 mg, the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> increased proportionally with
                    dose in general. Steady state was achieved within 8 days following repeated once
                    daily dosing. With repeated once daily administration, palbociclib accumulated
                    with a median accumulation ratio of 2.4 (range 1.5 to 4.2).</p>
                <h5>Food Effect</h5>
                <p>The area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC<sub>INF</sub>)
                    and C<sub>max</sub> of palbociclib increased by 22% and 26%, respectively, when
                    IBRANCE tablets were given with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800
                    to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein,
                    carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), and by 9% and 10%, respectively, when
                    IBRANCE tablets were given with a moderate-fat, standard-calorie meal
                    (approximately 500 to 700 calories with 75 to 105, 250 to 350 and 175 to 245
                    calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), compared to IBRANCE
                    tablets given under overnight fasted conditions.</p>

                <h4>Distribution</h4>
                <p>Binding of palbociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 85%,
                    with no concentration dependence over the concentration range of 500 ng/mL to
                    5000 ng/mL. The mean fraction unbound (f<sub>u</sub>) of palbociclib in human
                    plasma in vivo increased incrementally with worsening hepatic function. There
                    was no obvious trend in the mean palbociclib f<sub>u</sub> in human plasma in
                    vivo with worsening renal function. The geometric mean apparent volume of
                    distribution (V<sub>z</sub>/F) was 2583 L with a coefficient of variation (CV)
                    of 26%.</p>

                <h4>Metabolism</h4>
                <p>In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that palbociclib undergoes hepatic
                    metabolism in humans. Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of [<sup>
                    14</sup>C]palbociclib to humans, the primary metabolic pathways for palbociclib
                    involved oxidation and sulfonation, with acylation and glucuronidation
                    contributing as minor pathways. Palbociclib was the major circulating
                    drug-derived entity in plasma (23%). The major circulating metabolite was a
                    glucuronide conjugate of palbociclib, although it only represented 1.5% of the
                    administered dose in the excreta. Palbociclib was extensively metabolized with
                    unchanged drug accounting for 2.3% and 6.9% of radioactivity in feces and urine,
                    respectively. In feces, the sulfamic acid conjugate of palbociclib was the major
                    drug-related component, accounting for 26% of the administered dose. In vitro
                    studies with human hepatocytes, liver cytosolic and S9 fractions, and
                    recombinant SULT enzymes indicated that CYP3A and SULT2A1 are mainly involved in
                    the metabolism of palbociclib.</p>

                <h4>Elimination</h4>
                <p>The geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of palbociclib was 63.1 L/hr
                    (29% CV), and the mean (± standard deviation) plasma elimination half-life was
                    29 (±5) hours in patients with advanced breast cancer. In 6 healthy male
                    subjects given a single oral dose of [<sup>14</sup>C]palbociclib, a median of
                    91.6% of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered in 15 days; feces
                    (74.1% of dose) was the major route of excretion, with 17.5% of the dose
                    recovered in urine. The majority of the material was excreted as metabolites.</p>

                <h4>Age, Gender, and Body Weight</h4>
                <p>Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 183 patients with cancer (50
                    male and 133 female patients, age range from 22 to 89 years, and body weight
                    range from 37.9 to 123 kg), gender had no effect on the exposure of palbociclib,
                    and age and body weight had no clinically important effect on the exposure of
                    palbociclib.</p>

                <h4>Pediatric Population</h4>
                <p>Pharmacokinetics of IBRANCE have not been evaluated in patients <18 years of age.</p>

                <h4>Hepatic Impairment</h4>
                <p>Data from a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic
                    impairment indicate that palbociclib unbound AUC<sub>INF</sub> decreased 17% in
                    subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), and increased by 34%
                    and 77% in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe (Child-Pugh
                    class C) hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal
                    hepatic function. Palbociclib unbound C<sub>max</sub> increased by 7%, 38% and
                    72% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to
                    subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, based on a population
                    pharmacokinetic analysis that included 183 patients, where 40 patients had mild
                    hepatic impairment based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification
                    (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and
                    any AST), mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of palbociclib,
                    further supporting the findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment study.</p>

                <h4>Renal Impairment</h4>
                <p>Data from a pharmacokinetic trial in subjects with varying degrees of renal
                    impairment indicate that palbociclib AUC<sub>INF</sub> increased by 39%, 42%,
                    and 31% with mild (60 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 90 mL/min), moderate (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl <60 mL/min), and severe (CrCl <30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. Peak palbociclib exposure (C<sub>max</sub>) increased by 17%, 12%,
                    and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative
                    to subjects with normal renal function. In addition, based on a population
                    pharmacokinetic analysis that included 183 patients where 73 patients had mild
                    renal impairment and 29 patients had moderate renal impairment, mild and
                    moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure of palbociclib. The
                    pharmacokinetics of palbociclib have not been studied in patients requiring
                    hemodialysis.</p>

                <h4>Drug Interactions</h4>
                <p>In vitro data indicate that CYP3A and SULT enzyme SULT2A1 are mainly involved in
                    the metabolism of palbociclib. Palbociclib is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of
                    CYP3A following daily 125 mg dosing to steady state in humans. In vitro,
                    palbociclib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6,
                    and is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clinically relevant
                    concentrations.</p>
                <h5>CYP3A Inhibitors</h5>
                <p>Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects (N=12) indicate that
                    coadministration of multiple 200 mg daily doses of itraconazole with a single
                    125 mg IBRANCE dose increased palbociclib AUC<sub>INF</sub> and the C<sub>max</sub>
                    by approximately 87% and 34%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE
                    dose given alone <i>[see <a href="#S7.1">DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)</a>]</i>.</p>
                <h5>CYP3A Inducers</h5>
                <p>Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects (N=15) indicate that
                    coadministration of multiple 600 mg daily doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A
                    inducer, with a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUC<sub>INF</sub>
                    and C<sub>max</sub> by 85% and 70%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg
                    IBRANCE dose given alone. Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects
                    (N=14) indicate that coadministration of multiple 400 mg daily doses of
                    modafinil, a moderate CYP3A inducer, with a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased
                    palbociclib AUC<sub>INF</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> by 32% and 11%, respectively,
                    relative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone <i>[see <a href="#S7.2">DRUG
                    INTERACTIONS (7.2)</a>]</i>.</p>
                <h5>CYP3A Substrates</h5>
                <p>Palbociclib is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg
                    dosing to steady state in humans. In a drug interaction trial in healthy
                    subjects (N=26), coadministration of midazolam with multiple doses of IBRANCE
                    increased the midazolam AUC<sub>INF</sub> and the C<sub>max</sub> values by 61%
                    and 37%, respectively, as compared to administration of midazolam alone <i>[see <a
                            href="#S7.3">DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3)</a>]</i>.</p>
                <h5>Gastric pH Elevating Medications</h5>
                <p>In a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, coadministration of a single 125
                    mg IBRANCE tablet with multiple doses of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
                    rabeprazole under overnight fasted conditions had no effect on the rate and
                    extent of absorption of palbociclib when compared to a single 125 mg IBRANCE
                    tablet administered alone. Given the reduced effect on gastric pH of H2-receptor
                    antagonists and local antacids compared to PPIs, an effect of these classes of
                    acid reducing agents on palbociclib exposure is not expected.</p>
                <h5>Letrozole</h5>
                <p>Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer showed that there was
                    no drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole when the 2 drugs were
                    coadministered.</p>
                <h5>Fulvestrant</h5>
                <p>Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer showed that there was
                    no clinically relevant drug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant when
                    the 2 drugs were coadministered.</p>
                <h5>Goserelin</h5>
                <p>Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer showed that there was
                    no clinically relevant drug interaction between palbociclib and goserelin when
                    the 2 drugs were coadministered.</p>
                <h5>Anastrozole or Exemestane</h5>
                <p>No clinical data are available to evaluate drug interactions between anastrozole
                    or exemestane and palbociclib. A clinically significant drug interaction between
                    anastrozole or exemestane and palbociclib is not expected based on analyses of
                    the effects of anastrozole, exemestane and palbociclib on or by metabolic
                    pathways or transporter systems.</p>
                <h5>Effect of Palbociclib on Transporters</h5>
                <p>In vitro evaluations indicated that palbociclib has a low potential to inhibit
                    the activities of drug transporters organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3,
                    organic cation transporter (OCT)2, and organic anion transporting polypeptide
                    (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, palbociclib
                    has the potential to inhibit OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations, as well
                    as the potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance
                    protein (BCRP) in the gastrointestinal tract at the proposed dose.</p>
                <h5>Effect of Transporters on Palbociclib</h5>
                <p>Based on in vitro data, P-gp and BCRP mediated transport are unlikely to affect
                    the extent of oral absorption of palbociclib at therapeutic doses.</p>

                <h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3>
                <p>Palbociclib was assessed for carcinogenicity in a 6-month transgenic mouse study
                    and in a 2-year rat study. Oral administration of palbociclib for 2 years
                    resulted in an increased incidence of microglial cell tumors in the central
                    nervous system of male rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the
                    human clinical exposure based on AUC). There were no neoplastic findings in
                    female rats at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the human
                    clinical exposure based on AUC). Oral administration of palbociclib to male and
                    female rasH2 transgenic mice for 6 months did not result in increased incidence
                    of neoplasms at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day.</p>
                <p>Palbociclib was aneugenic in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in vitro and in the bone
                    marrow of male rats at doses ≥100 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. Palbociclib was not
                    mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not
                    clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay.</p>
                <p>In a fertility study in female rats, palbociclib did not affect mating or
                    fertility at any dose up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times human clinical
                    exposure based on AUC) and no adverse effects were observed in the female
                    reproductive tissues in repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 300 mg/kg/day in the
                    rat and 3 mg/kg/day in the dog (approximately 6 times and similar to human
                    exposure [AUC], at the recommended dose, respectively).</p>
                <p>The adverse effects of palbociclib on male reproductive function and fertility
                    were observed in the repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs and a male
                    fertility study in rats. In repeat-dose toxicology studies, palbociclib-related
                    findings in the testis, epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle at ≥30
                    mg/kg/day in rats and ≥0.2 mg/kg/day in dogs included decreased organ weight,
                    atrophy or degeneration, hypospermia, intratubular cellular debris, and
                    decreased secretion. Partial reversibility of male reproductive organ effects
                    was observed in the rat and dog following a 4- and 12-week non-dosing period,
                    respectively. These doses in rats and dogs resulted in approximately ≥10 and 0.1
                    times, respectively, the exposure [AUC] in humans at the recommended dose. In
                    the fertility and early embryonic development study in male rats, palbociclib
                    caused no effects on mating but resulted in a slight decrease in fertility in
                    association with lower sperm motility and density at 100 mg/kg/day with
                    projected exposure levels [AUC] of 20 times the exposure in humans at the
                    recommended dose.</p>

                <h3>PALOMA-2: IBRANCE plus Letrozole</h3>
                <h4>Patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer
                    for initial endocrine based therapy</h4>
                <p>PALOMA-2 was an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
                    multicenter study of IBRANCE plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole
                    conducted in postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced
                    breast cancer who had not received previous systemic treatment for their
                    advanced disease. A total of 666 patients were randomized 2:1 to IBRANCE plus
                    letrozole or placebo plus letrozole. Randomization was stratified by disease
                    site (visceral versus non-visceral), disease-free interval (de novo metastatic
                    versus ≤12 months from the end of adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence
                    versus >12 months from the end of adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence), and
                    nature of prior (neo)adjuvant anticancer therapies (prior hormonal therapies
                    versus no prior hormonal therapy). IBRANCE was given orally at a dose of 125 mg
                    daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment. Patients
                    received study treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic
                    deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever
                    occurred first. The major efficacy outcome of the study was
                    investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to
                    Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST). Additional
                    efficacy outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate (ORR) as assessed
                    by the investigator according to RECIST Version 1.1 and overall survival (OS).</p>
                <p>Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 62 years (range 28 to 89).
                    The majority of patients were White (78%), and most patients had an Eastern
                    Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 (98%).
                    Forty-eight percent of patients had received chemotherapy and 56% had received
                    antihormonal therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting prior to their
                    diagnosis of advanced breast cancer. Thirty-seven percent of patients had no
                    prior systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. The majority of
                    patients (97%) had metastatic disease. Twenty-three percent of patients had bone
                    only disease, and 49% of patients had visceral disease.</p>
                <p>Major efficacy results from PALOMA-2 are summarized in Table 8 and Figure 1.
                    Consistent results were observed across patient subgroups of disease-free
                    interval (DFI), disease site, and prior therapy. The treatment effect of the
                    combination on PFS was also supported by an independent review of radiographs.
                    Based on the prespecified final OS analysis conducted after 435 events, OS was
                    not statistically significant.</p>

                <p>PALOMA-3 was an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
                    multicenter study of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant
                    conducted in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer,
                    regardless of their menopausal status, whose disease progressed on or after
                    prior endocrine therapy. A total of 521 pre/postmenopausal women were randomized
                    2:1 to IBRANCE plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant and stratified by
                    documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status at study
                    entry (pre/peri versus postmenopausal), and presence of visceral metastases.
                    IBRANCE was given orally at a dose of 125 mg daily for 21 consecutive days
                    followed by 7 days off treatment. Pre/perimenopausal women were enrolled in the
                    study and received the LHRH agonist goserelin for at least 4 weeks prior to and
                    for the duration of PALOMA-3. Patients continued to receive assigned treatment
                    until objective disease progression, symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable
                    toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. The major
                    efficacy outcome of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according
                    to RECIST 1.1.</p>
                <p>Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 57 years (range 29 to 88).

                    of 0 or 1, and 80% were postmenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic
                    therapy, and 75% of patients had received a previous chemotherapy regimen.
                    Twenty-five percent of patients had received no prior therapy in the metastatic
                    disease setting, 60% had visceral metastases, and 23% had bone only disease.</p>
                <p>The results from the investigator-assessed PFS and final OS from PALOMA-3 are
                    summarized in Table 9. The relevant Kaplan-Meier plots are shown in Figures 2
                    and 3, respectively. Consistent PFS results were observed across patient
                    subgroups of disease site, sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and menopausal
                    status. After a median follow-up time of 45 months, the final OS results were
                    not statistically significant.</p>
