          <p>During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.</p>
          <p>When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX activity in patients' blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.</p>

          <p>The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which is related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma).</p>

          <p>Alternatively, for long term prophylaxis against bleeding, in another clinical study, BeneFIX was administered as 100 IU/kg once weekly (see section 5.1).</p>

          <p><u>Hypersensitivity</u></p>
          <p>Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with BeneFIX. The product contains traces of hamster proteins. Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, generalised urticaria, itching, tightness of the chest, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, wheezing, hypotension, blurred vision, and anaphylaxis.</p>
          <p>In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis. In the case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock should be observed. In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.</p>
          <p><u>Inhibitors</u></p>
          <p>Inhibitors are an uncommon event in previously treated patients (PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products. As one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor during clinical studies and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, patients treated with BeneFIX should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors that should be titrated in Bethesda Units using appropriate biological testing.</p>
          <p>There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX. Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions. Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product.</p>
          <p>Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician's judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.</p>
          <p><u>Thrombosis</u></p>
          <p>Although BeneFIX contains only factor IX, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be recognised. Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be weighed against the risk of these complications.</p>
          <p>The safety and efficacy of BeneFIX administration by continuous infusion have not been established (see also sections 4.2 and 4.8). There have been post-marketing reports of thrombotic events, including life-threatening superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome in critically ill neonates, while receiving continuous-infusion BeneFIX through a central venous catheter (see also section 4.8).</p>
          <p><u>Cardiovascular events</u></p>
          <p>In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the cardiovascular risk.</p>
          <p><u>Nephrotic syndrome</u></p>
          <p>Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction. The safety and efficacy of using BeneFIX for immune tolerance induction has not been established.</p>
          <p><u>Special populations</u></p>
          <p>Sufficient data have not been obtained from clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs) with BeneFIX.</p>
          <p><u>Sodium content</u></p>
          <p>After reconstitution, BeneFIX contains 0.2 mmol sodium (4.6 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially â€˜sodium-free'. Depending on body weight of the patient and posology of BeneFIX, patients could receive multiple vials. This should be taken into consideration if the patient is on a low salt diet.</p>

          <p><u>Summary of the safety profile</u></p>
          <p>Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitors (see also section 4.4). Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction.</p>
          <p>Very rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has been observed.</p>
          <p>Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.</p>
          <p>There is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX products, see section 4.4.</p>
          <p><u>Tabulated list of adverse reactions</u></p>
          <p>The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred Term Level). Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (â‰¥ 1/10); common (â‰¥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (â‰¥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). The table lists adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials of previously treated patients and identified in postmarketing use. The frequencies are based on all causality treatment emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials with 224 subjects.</p>
          <p>Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.</p>

          <p><u><i>Inhibitor development</i></u></p>
          <p>A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients (including 9 patients participating only in the surgery study) who had previously received plasma-derived products. This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no anamnestic rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis (see section 4.4).</p>

Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 55,000 Daltons that is a member of the serine protease family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic which has structural and functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX. Factor IX is activated by factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway as well as factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. Factor IX activity is absent or greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required.</p>
