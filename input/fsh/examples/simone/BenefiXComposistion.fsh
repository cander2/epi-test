          <p>During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.</p>
          <p>When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX activity in patients' blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.</p>
